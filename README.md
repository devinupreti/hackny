##Inspiration  
The application was driven by our inclination to work around something that involves GIFs


##What it does  
Soliso is an android application that provides its users with GIFs which can be generated through voice search or through any image captured with the phone camera.


##How we built it 
We used the APIs made available to us by giphy and clarifai to integrate their functionalities and produce a unique application.


##Challenges we ran into  
It was a small and quick app idea to be completed in a day. We had fun building it!


##Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We built an app which we would use ourselves! It's Great for quick GIF comebacks while texting


##What we learned  
We learned working for 15 hours straight.

##What's next for Soliso  
Soliso is still far from perfect and we think many more functionalities can be added to the application such as video to GIFs, instant voice recognition and more.
